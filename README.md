- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
- **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### Agile Principles

1. Customer satisfaction is achieved through early and continuous delivery of software.
2. Changing requirements should be accepted, even in the late stages of development.
3. Development should be delivered in small increments at regular intervals.
4. Stakeholders should collaborate daily throughout the project.
5. Teams should be trusted and motivated.
6. Face-to-face communication is the most effective way to exchange information.
7. The primary measure of progress is working software.
8. A consistent and sustainable pace should be maintained.

## Scrum

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is one of the Agile project management methodologies used by organizations, teams, and individuals to manage complex processes. Its flexible structure enables teams to adapt to customer needs and changes. Scrum breaks down the whole into smaller, iterative parts, ensuring continuous improvement through frequent evaluations. Modifying or omitting core Scrum elements can limit its effectiveness and lead to issues.

### Scrum Principles

1. **Transparency** – The project's progress, new developments, and encountered issues should be visible to everyone.
2. **Inspection** – The project's status should be regularly reviewed.
3. **Adaptation** – The project and team members should be able to adapt to changes.

### Scrum Values

- **Commitment**
- **Courage**
- **Focus**
- **Openness**
- **Respect**

### Scrum Team

A Scrum team consists of:

- **Product Owner** – Acts as the bridge between customers and the development team, managing the Product Backlog to ensure transparency and clarity.
- **Scrum Master** – Ensures adherence to Scrum principles, removes obstacles, and fosters team productivity.
- **Development Team** – Responsible for completing all tasks within a Sprint, self-organizing and cross-functional.

### Scrum Activities

#### **Sprint**
A Sprint is the core of Scrum, where ideas are transformed into value within a time-boxed iteration (a maximum of one month). Each Sprint begins immediately after the previous one ends. If a Sprint Goal becomes invalid, only the Product Owner can cancel it.

#### **Sprint Planning**
Sprint Planning marks the beginning of a Sprint. The Product Backlog is broken into smaller tasks, and responsibilities are distributed among the team members. This meeting includes the Product Owner, Development Team, and Scrum Master.

#### **Daily Scrum**
A 15-minute daily meeting where the Scrum Team discusses progress, identifies obstacles, and finds solutions. It occurs at the same time and place every workday to maintain consistency.

#### **Sprint Review**
A meeting to evaluate the Sprint's outcome, ensure the developed software meets the Product Owner’s requirements, and determine future adjustments.

#### **Sprint Retrospective**
A session to identify ways to improve quality. The team discusses what worked well, challenges faced, solutions applied, and unresolved issues. The most beneficial changes are implemented, sometimes even added to the Sprint Backlog for immediate action.
